# Multi-Provider Switching Troubleshooting Report

## 1. Initial Problem: Provider Switching Failure

The primary issue was a failure in the provider-switching mechanism. When a user selected a new AI provider in the frontend, the backend would silently ignore the selection and default to the Google provider. This resulted in errors when a model incompatible with the Google provider (e.g., `gpt-4`) was used in a workflow, as the request was incorrectly routed.

## 2. Investigation and Remediation Efforts

### Round 1: Backend Logic and Frontend State Propagation

**Hypothesis:** The backend was not correctly retrieving or prioritizing the user's selected provider, and the frontend was not sending the provider information during workflow execution.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **`providerValidationService.ts`:**
    *   Modified the `getPreferredProvider` function to accept the Express `req` object.
    *   Updated its logic to first check for a `preferredProvider` stored in the user's session before falling back to environment variable defaults.

2.  **`providerController.ts`:**
    *   Updated all internal calls to `getPreferredProvider` to pass the `req` object.
    *   Modified the `saveApiKey` function to set the `preferredProvider` in the user's session (`req.session.preferredProvider`) upon successful validation and saving of an API key.

3.  **`unifiedAIService.ts`:**
    *   Refactored all AI-calling methods (`testPrompt`, `generateSFLFromGoal`, etc.) to accept the `req` object.
    *   This allows the service to determine the user's preferred provider from their session instead of defaulting to a hardcoded value.

4.  **`useWorkflowRunner.ts` & `workflowEngine.ts`:**
    *   Modified the hooks and services to accept an `ActiveProviderConfig` object.
    *   This configuration is now passed to the backend during `/api/workflows/execute` and `/api/workflows/run-task` API calls, ensuring the backend receives the frontend's current provider context.

5.  **`PromptLabPage.tsx` & `WorkflowCanvas.tsx`:**
    *   Updated the `PromptLabPage` to manage the `ActiveProviderConfig` state.
    *   A `ProviderSwitcher` component was added to the page.
    *   The provider configuration state is now passed down to the `WorkflowCanvas` and subsequently to the `useWorkflowRunner` hook.

### Round 2: Build Failures and Type Definitions

**Problem:** The Docker build began failing with TypeScript errors (`TS2339: Property 'preferredProvider' does not exist on type 'Session & Partial<SessionData>'`).

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **Created `backend/src/types/express-session.d.ts`:**
    *   A new type declaration file was created to extend the `express-session` module.
    *   This file adds the `apiKeys`, `baseUrls`, and `preferredProvider` properties to the `SessionData` interface, making the compiler aware of the custom session properties.

### Round 3: Frontend State and UI Inconsistencies

**Problem:** After fixing the build, the UI on the Prompt Lab page still showed all providers as disconnected (red dots), with an "API key not configured" message, even after a key was successfully validated on the Settings page. The Settings page itself did not provide clear feedback that a key had been saved.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **`ProviderSetupPage.tsx` (Settings):**
    *   Introduced a `storedProviders` state, which is fetched from the backend on component mount.
    *   The UI was updated to display a "âœ“ Configured" status next to providers that have a key stored in the session.
    *   The `handleValidate` function was updated to add the newly configured provider to the `storedProviders` state upon success, providing immediate UI feedback.

2.  **`ProviderSwitcher.tsx`:**
    *   Added a new `onProvidersLoaded` prop to allow the component to pass the fetched provider data (both available and configured providers) up to its parent component.

3.  **`PromptLabPage.tsx`:**
    *   Updated to use the `onProvidersLoaded` callback from the `ProviderSwitcher` to populate its own state, ensuring the main lab interface is aware of which providers are configured.

### Round 4: Model Mismatch Error

**Problem:** The backend logs revealed a new error: `Model gpt-4 not found for provider google`. This indicated that while the provider was being switched, the selected model was not being updated correctly in the frontend state, leading to an invalid combination being sent to the backend.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **`ProviderSwitcher.tsx`:**
    *   Corrected the `handleProviderChange` function. It was previously only calling `onConfigChange` but not updating its own internal `currentProviderConfig` state.
    *   The fix ensures that when a new provider is selected, the component's internal state is updated, and a valid default model for the *new* provider is set in the `ActiveProviderConfig` that is passed to the parent.

### Round 7: Detailed Architectural Refactor (ARIA Principles)

**Problem:** All previous attempts were piecemeal and failed to address the fundamental architectural flaw: decentralized state management. This created race conditions and synchronization issues between components. A full architectural refactor was undertaken.

**Specific Changes Implemented:**

1.  **Backend (`/backend`)**
    *   **`api/controllers/providerController.ts`**:
        *   Added a new `envCheck` method and corresponding `/api/providers/env-check` route to allow the frontend to discover which providers are configured via server-side environment variables.
        *   Modified `getAvailableProviders` to be `async` to correctly handle promises.
        *   Updated `getProviderStatus`, `checkProviderHealth`, and `getPreferredProvider` to accept the `req` object, allowing them to read user-specific session data.
        *   The `saveApiKey` method now sets the `preferredProvider` in the user's session upon successful validation.
        *   The `proxyGenerate` method was simplified to rely entirely on the `UnifiedAIService` to resolve the correct API key, removing redundant logic.
    *   **`services/providerValidationService.ts`**:
        *   The `getPreferredProvider` function was modified to accept the `req` object and now prioritizes the `preferredProvider` from the user's session over environment variable defaults.
    *   **`services/unifiedAIService.ts`**:
        *   All public methods (`testPrompt`, `generateSFLFromGoal`, etc.) were updated to accept the `req` object, allowing them to use the session-based preferred provider.
    *   **`types/express-session.d.ts`**:
        *   This new file was created to add custom properties (`apiKeys`, `baseUrls`, `preferredProvider`) to the `express-session` `SessionData` type, resolving TypeScript build errors.

2.  **Frontend (`/frontend`)**
    *   **`App.tsx` (Core State Hub)**:
        *   Became the single source of truth for all provider-related state (`activeProviderConfig`, `storedProviders`).
        *   All logic for fetching, managing, and updating this state was centralized here, including the `handleConfigChange` and `handleSaveApiKey` functions.
        *   This central state is now passed down as props to all relevant child components.
    *   **`hooks/useProviderValidation.ts`**:
        *   This hook was enhanced to also fetch and manage the list of `storedProviders`, making this data available globally via `App.tsx`.
    *   **`hooks/useEnvSettings.ts`**:
        *   This new hook was created to call the new `/api/providers/env-check` endpoint, although its direct use was superseded by the full state centralization in `App.tsx`.
    *   **`components/settings/ProviderSetupPage.tsx`**:
        *   Refactored into a "dumb" component. It no longer fetches its own data or manages its own state, receiving `storedProviders` and the `onSaveApiKey` handler as props from `App.tsx`.
    *   **`components/lab/PromptLabPage.tsx`**:
        *   Refactored into a "dumb" component. It no longer manages its own `activeProviderConfig` state, receiving it as a prop from `App.tsx`.
    *   **`components/ProviderSwitcher.tsx`**:
        *   Refactored into a "dumb" component, receiving `currentConfig`, `onConfigChange`, and `storedProviders` as props. It no longer contains any local state for these values.
    *   **`hooks/useWorkflowRunner.ts` & `services/workflowEngine.ts`**:
        *   These were updated to ensure the `providerConfig` is correctly passed through to the backend during workflow execution API calls.

## Round 8: Comprehensive Debugging and Architectural Resolution

**Problem:** Despite previous refactoring attempts, the multi-provider system still exhibited critical issues:
- Blank settings page with console errors
- Complex multi-layer state management causing race conditions
- Session-based provider preferences violating stateless API principles
- Provider/model synchronization problems
- Over-engineered architecture compared to working implementations

**Approach:** Conducted systematic debugging using the Agent Organizer Protocol with specialized agents, referencing both the SFL Prompt Studio knowledge base and the working ARIA implementation patterns.

### Phase 1: Immediate Issue Resolution (2025-08-28)

**Context Manager Analysis:**
- Mapped comprehensive project structure and identified all provider-related files
- Located 25+ files across frontend/backend involved in multi-provider implementation
- Identified recent modifications suggesting active but problematic development

**Debugger Investigation:**
- **Root Cause**: Inconsistent TypeScript type import paths causing blank ProviderSetupPage
- **Issue**: Conflicting AIProvider type definitions in multiple locations
- **Fix**: Standardized type imports and created proper type re-exports in `/frontend/types.ts`

**Backend Compilation Fixes:**
- Resolved TypeScript session type augmentation issues
- Added temporary type assertions for `preferredProvider` session properties
- Ensured both frontend (port 5173) and backend (port 3001) services running successfully

### Phase 2: Backend Architecture Simplification

**Backend Architect Analysis:**
- Identified session-based provider preferences as core architectural anti-pattern
- Analyzed over-engineered state management (4+ layers: session + localStorage + React state + Express sessions)
- Proposed stateless backend following ARIA working patterns

**Key Architectural Insights:**
```
ARIA (Working):
- Single React state object for provider config
- Environment variable fallbacks for API keys  
- Direct provider validation without session complexity

SFL (Broken):
- Complex multi-layer state management
- Session-based provider preferences
- Asynchronous state propagation failures
```

### Phase 3: Frontend State Management Refactor

**Frontend Developer Implementation:**
- **Created Unified Provider Store** (`/frontend/store/providerStore.ts`):
  - Single source of truth using Zustand
  - Eliminates race conditions between state layers
  - Automatic provider/model synchronization
  - Environment variable fallback support

**Component Refactoring:**
- **App.tsx**: Removed complex prop drilling, uses provider store directly
- **ProviderSwitcher.tsx**: Converted to reactive component with immediate updates  
- **PromptLabPage.tsx**: Simplified to use provider store hooks
- **ProviderSetupPage.tsx**: Integrated with provider store for automatic refresh

**Added Support Infrastructure:**
- **useEnvProviders.ts**: Environment variable detection hook
- **ProviderStatus.tsx**: Debug component for testing the new store

### Phase 4: Architectural Validation

**Architect Reviewer Assessment:**
- **Rating**: â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜† (4/5) architectural maturity
- **Validated**: Single source of truth eliminating conflicts
- **Confirmed**: Stateless backend design with environment defaults
- **Verified**: End-to-end provider switching functionality

**Key Improvements Validated:**
1. **Eliminated State Complexity**: Reduced from 4-5 state layers to 1 unified store  
2. **Fixed Synchronization**: Provider/model changes now atomic and immediate
3. **Environment Fallbacks**: Pre-configured providers via environment variables
4. **Better Error Handling**: Centralized error states with proper recovery
5. **Performance**: Selective re-renders using Zustand selectors
