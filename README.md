# SFL Prompt Architect

A sophisticated prompt engineering tool built on **Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL)** principles to help you create, test, and manage AI prompts with precision and theoretical grounding.

## What is SFL Prompt Architect?

SFL Prompt Architect transforms the art of prompt engineering into a structured, linguistic science. By applying Systemic Functional Linguistics theory, it breaks down every prompt into three fundamental dimensions:

- **Field** (What's happening): The subject matter, domain, and task type
- **Tenor** (Who's involved): The AI persona, target audience, and interpersonal dynamics  
- **Mode** (How it's communicated): Output format, structure, and textual directives

This systematic approach ensures your prompts are not just functional, but optimally crafted for their intended purpose.

### Manual Installation

1. **Clone and install dependencies**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd sfl-prompt-architect
   npm install  # Install root dependencies
   cd frontend && npm install  # Install frontend dependencies
   cd ../backend && npm install  # Install backend dependencies
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**

   **Frontend** (`.env.local`):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   echo "VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env.local
   ```

   **Backend** (`.env`):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   cat > .env << EOF
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/sfl_prompt_architect
   REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=4000
   EOF
   ```

3. **Set up the database**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run migrate:up  # Run database migrations
   ```

4. **Start development servers**

   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   npm run dev:backend

   # Terminal 2 - Frontend  
   npm run dev:frontend
   ```

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build  # Builds both frontend and backend
```

### Documentation

Generate complete API documentation:

```bash
npm run docs  # Generates unified documentation
```

View the documentation by opening `docs/index.html` in your browser.

## Illustrative Use Cases

### 1. **Content Creator: Educational Explainer**

**Scenario**: Sarah creates educational content for her YouTube channel about science topics.

**SFL Breakdown**:

- **Field**: Astrophysics, Explanation task, Simple analogies needed
- **Tenor**: Friendly Teacher persona, Children (5-7 years) audience, Engaging tone
- **Mode**: Plain text, Analogy-first structure, Short paragraph (~50 words)

**Example Prompt Created**:

```shell
"Explain what a black hole is in simple terms that a 5-year-old can understand. Use an analogy that relates to everyday objects they know. Keep it engaging and wonder-filled."
```

**Use**: Sarah tests this prompt, gets: *"Imagine a super-duper vacuum cleaner in space that's so strong it can suck up everything, even light! That's kind of like a black hole."*

### 2. **Software Developer: Code Generation**

**Scenario**: Alex needs to generate Python functions for various algorithmic problems.

**SFL Breakdown**:

- **Field**: Programming, Code Generation, Python/Algorithms
- **Tenor**: Expert Coder persona, Software Developers audience, Concise/Technical tone
- **Mode**: Python Code format, Function definition structure, Include type hints

**Example Prompt Created**:

```shell
"Write a Python function called `{{function_name}}` that {{task_description}}. Include proper type hints, docstring, and handle edge cases. Make it production-ready."
```

**Use**: Alex creates templates with variables, then generates specific functions by filling in `{{function_name}}` and `{{task_description}}`.

### 3. **Business Analyst: Report Summarization**
