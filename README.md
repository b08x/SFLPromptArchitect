# SFL Prompt Architect

A sophisticated prompt engineering tool built on **Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL)** principles to help you create, test, and manage AI prompts with precision and theoretical grounding.

## What is SFL Prompt Architect?

SFL Prompt Architect transforms the art of prompt engineering into a structured, linguistic science. By applying Systemic Functional Linguistics theory, it breaks down every prompt into three fundamental dimensions:

- **Field** (What's happening): The subject matter, domain, and task type
- **Tenor** (Who's involved): The AI persona, target audience, and interpersonal dynamics  
- **Mode** (How it's communicated): Output format, structure, and textual directives

This systematic approach ensures your prompts are not just functional, but optimally crafted for their intended purpose.

## Key Features

## Illustrative Use Cases

### 1. **Content Creator: Educational Explainer**

**Scenario**: Sarah creates educational content for her YouTube channel about science topics.

**SFL Breakdown**:

- **Field**: Astrophysics, Explanation task, Simple analogies needed
- **Tenor**: Friendly Teacher persona, Children (5-7 years) audience, Engaging tone
- **Mode**: Plain text, Analogy-first structure, Short paragraph (~50 words)

**Example Prompt Created**:

```
"Explain what a black hole is in simple terms that a 5-year-old can understand. Use an analogy that relates to everyday objects they know. Keep it engaging and wonder-filled."
```

**Use**: Sarah tests this prompt, gets: *"Imagine a super-duper vacuum cleaner in space that's so strong it can suck up everything, even light! That's kind of like a black hole."*

### 2. **Software Developer: Code Generation**

**Scenario**: Alex needs to generate Python functions for various algorithmic problems.

**SFL Breakdown**:

- **Field**: Programming, Code Generation, Python/Algorithms
- **Tenor**: Expert Coder persona, Software Developers audience, Concise/Technical tone
- **Mode**: Python Code format, Function definition structure, Include type hints

**Example Prompt Created**:

```
"Write a Python function called `{{function_name}}` that {{task_description}}. Include proper type hints, docstring, and handle edge cases. Make it production-ready."
```

**Use**: Alex creates templates with variables, then generates specific functions by filling in `{{function_name}}` and `{{task_description}}`.

### 3. **Business Analyst: Report Summarization**

**Scenario**: Maria needs to summarize complex market research reports for executive briefings.

**SFL Breakdown**:

- **Field**: Business Analysis, Summarization, Market Research
- **Tenor**: Neutral Reporter persona, Business Professionals audience, Objective tone
- **Mode**: Bullet Points format, Key findings structure, Executive summary length

**Example Prompt Created**:

```
"Summarize the following market research report for C-level executives. Focus on key findings, market trends, and actionable insights. Present as bullet points with clear categories: Market Size, Competition, Opportunities, Risks."
```

**Use**: Maria tests with sample reports, refines the prompt until it consistently produces executive-ready summaries.

### 4. **Creative Writer: Character Development**

**Scenario**: David writes fantasy novels and needs help developing consistent character personalities.

**SFL Breakdown**:

- **Field**: Creative Writing, Character Development, Fantasy genre
- **Tenor**: Creative Muse persona, Writers audience, Imaginative tone
- **Mode**: Detailed description format, Character profile structure, Multiple paragraphs

**Example Prompt Created**:

```
"Create a detailed character profile for a {{character_type}} in a fantasy setting. Include personality traits, backstory, motivations, fears, and how they speak. Make them feel authentic and three-dimensional with internal contradictions that create depth."
```

**Use**: David uses variables like `{{character_type}}` to generate profiles for different roles (warrior, mage, merchant), building a consistent world.

### 5. **Researcher: Literature Review**

**Scenario**: Dr. Chen conducts academic research and needs help analyzing research papers.

**SFL Breakdown**:

- **Field**: Academic Research, Analysis, Literature Review
- **Tenor**: Expert persona, Academic Researchers audience, Formal tone
- **Mode**: Structured report format, Critical analysis structure, Detailed analysis

**Example Prompt Created**:

```
"Analyze the following research paper and provide a critical review covering: methodology strengths/weaknesses, contribution to the field, limitations, and potential future research directions. Maintain academic rigor and cite specific examples from the text."
```

**Use**: Dr. Chen tests with various paper types, adjusts the prompt to ensure consistent analytical depth across different research domains.

### 6. **Marketing Professional: Campaign Brainstorming**

**Scenario**: Lisa needs fresh ideas for marketing campaigns across different demographics.

**SFL Breakdown**:

- **Field**: Marketing, Brainstorming, Campaign Development
- **Tenor**: Creative Muse persona, Business Professionals audience, Enthusiastic tone
- **Mode**: Bullet Points format, Campaign concept structure, Multiple ideas

**Example Prompt Created**:

```
"Generate 5 creative marketing campaign ideas for {{product_type}} targeting {{target_demographic}}. For each idea, include: core concept, key message, channel strategy, and what makes it unique. Think outside the box while staying brand-appropriate."
```

**Use**: Lisa creates template prompts with variables, then generates campaigns for different products and demographics, building a repository of tested concepts.

## Why SFL Matters for Prompt Engineering

Traditional prompt engineering often relies on trial and error. SFL Prompt Architect brings linguistic theory to bear on prompt design, ensuring:

1. **Completeness**: Every prompt addresses Field, Tenor, and Mode dimensions
2. **Consistency**: Structured approach leads to reliable results
3. **Optimization**: Understanding context helps craft more effective prompts
4. **Reusability**: Well-structured prompts can be adapted and reused
5. **Collaboration**: Shared framework enables team prompt development
