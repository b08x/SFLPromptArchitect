# TypeScript Compilation Issue in Docker Container

## Problem Summary
The backend Docker container is failing to start due to a TypeScript compilation error:
- Error: `TS7016: Could not find a declaration file for module 'ws'`
- Missing `@types/ws` dependency in the Docker container
- Container runs in development mode using `ts-node` instead of compiled JavaScript

## Root Cause
1. The `@types/ws` dependency was added locally but not properly included in the Docker build
2. The Docker container is running `npm run dev` (development mode with ts-node) instead of `npm start` (production mode with compiled JS)
3. The TypeScript compilation succeeds during Docker build but fails at runtime due to missing dev dependencies

## Current Status
- ✅ Local TypeScript compilation works (`npm run build` succeeds)
- ✅ Docker build process completes successfully
- ❌ Container crashes at runtime with TypeScript errors
- ✅ All other services (Redis, DB, Frontend) are running properly

## Solution Required
Either:
1. **Fix Development Mode**: Ensure `@types/ws` is available in the Docker container's development environment
2. **Switch to Production Mode**: Configure Docker Compose to run the compiled JavaScript instead of TypeScript

## Files Involved
- `backend/package.json` - Contains `@types/ws` dependency
- `backend/Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build process
- `docker-compose.yml` - Service configuration (determines dev vs prod mode)
- `backend/src/services/webSocketService.ts` - File with TypeScript errors

## Next Steps
1. Check Docker Compose configuration for backend service command
2. Verify package.json is properly copied with all dependencies
3. Either fix dev mode or switch to production mode for container startup
