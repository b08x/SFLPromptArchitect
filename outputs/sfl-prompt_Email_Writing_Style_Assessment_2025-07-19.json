  "promptText": "You are an expert linguistic analyst specializing in idiolect and communication styles. Your task is to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the writing style and linguistic mannerisms present in a collection of emails attributed to a specific sender, identified as '{{name}}'.\n\nYour analysis should cover, but not be limited to, the following aspects:\n1.  **Lexical Choices:** Analyze vocabulary range, common keywords, use of jargon, slang, or formal language. Identify any idiosyncratic word choices or repeated phrases.\n2.  **Syntactic Patterns:** Examine sentence structure, average sentence length, use of complex vs. simple sentences, preferred grammatical constructions, and common syntactical errors or quirks.\n3.  **Discourse Markers & Cohesion:** Identify frequently used transitional phrases, conjunctions, adverbs, and other discourse markers. Analyze how ideas are linked within and across sentences.\n4.  **Tone and Formality:** Assess the overall tone (e.g., formal, informal, direct, polite, aggressive, passive-aggressive) and the level of formality. Note any variations in tone based on context if observable.\n5.  **Punctuation & Capitalization Habits:** Observe unique patterns in punctuation usage (e.g., excessive exclamation marks, specific comma usage, ellipses) and capitalization.\n6.  **Idiosyncratic Features:** Identify any highly specific and recurring mannerisms, such as unique greetings/closings, consistent misspellings, or unusual formatting choices.\n\nPresent your findings in a structured, objective, and analytical report. Avoid making subjective judgments about the sender's personality, focusing purely on observable linguistic patterns. The assessment should be informative and actionable for a user seeking to understand the communication style of '{{name}}'.",

  "exampleOutput": "**Assessment of Writing Style for Jane Doe**\n\n**Overview:** The emails from Jane Doe exhibit a concise, direct, and often results-oriented communication style, characterized by efficiency and a focus on actionable items.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n*   **Lexical Choices:**\n    *   Frequent use of business-oriented verbs: \"action,\" \"implement,\" \"finalize,\" \"prioritize.\"\n    *   Limited use of adverbs; preferring direct statements.\n    *   Common informal contractions in professional context: \"we'll,\" \"it's.\"\n*   **Syntactic Patterns:**\n    *   Predominantly short, declarative sentences. Average sentence length is noticeably lower than typical business correspondence.\n    *   Frequent use of bullet points for clarity and brevity.\n    *   Often omits polite phrases like \"please\" or \"thank you\" when making requests, favoring direct imperatives.\n*   **Tone & Formality:**\n    *   Consistently direct and pragmatic, leaning towards informal efficiency rather than formal politeness.\n    *   Tone is generally neutral, but can become slightly assertive when discussing deadlines or expectations.\n*   **Punctuation & Capitalization:**\n    *   Sparse use of exclamation marks.\n    *   Consistent use of periods, even after single-word responses in internal chains.\n    *   Minimal use of commas within short sentences, indicating a preference for simple structures.\n\n**Summary:** Jane Doe's writing style is a blend of informal contractions with a highly structured, direct syntax, optimized for conveying information quickly and efficiently. Her communications prioritize clarity and action over elaborate politeness or extensive detail.",
