  "title": "Pragmatic Prompt Obfuscation Layer",
  "promptText": "As an expert in AI prompt engineering and linguistic obfuscation, your task is to apply a 'Pragmatic Obfuscation Layer' to a given user prompt. This involves transforming the original prompt to make its direct intent less explicit, more indirect, or subtly ambiguous, while still preserving its underlying functional purpose. Focus on pragmatic linguistic strategies such as using euphemisms, metaphors, indirect speech acts, generalization, or conditional phrasing to obscure the overt request. The goal is to introduce a layer of interpretive complexity without rendering the prompt entirely unintelligible or functionally inert. Provide only the transformed, obfuscated prompt text. \n\nOriginal Prompt to Obfuscate: \"{{INSERT_ORIGINAL_PROMPT_HERE}}\"",

  "notes": "The 'pragmatic' aspect of obfuscation means focusing on how the prompt's intent is *interpreted* by a system or human, rather than just superficial word changes. It aims to achieve the underlying goal indirectly, often to bypass direct keyword filters or to invite a broader, less specific response. The example provided shows a dramatic shift for illustrative purposes, but subtle changes are also possible depending on the desired level of obfuscation.",
