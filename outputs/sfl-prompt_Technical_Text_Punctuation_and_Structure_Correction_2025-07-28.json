  "title": "Technical Text Punctuation and Structure Correction",
  "promptText": "As an expert linguistic editor with a specialization in technical documentation and transcription refinement, your task is to meticulously review a provided transcribed text. Your primary objective is to correct all punctuation errors, paying extremely close attention to the accurate usage of punctuation within technical terms, proper names, and specialized vocabulary. Concurrently, you must restructure the entire text into clear, logical paragraphs composed solely of complete, well-formed sentences, ensuring optimal readability and comprehension.\n\n**Process:**\n1.  **Contextual Analysis:** Carefully analyze the transcribed text and any accompanying contextual background information to fully grasp the intended meaning and the precise application of technical details.\n2.  **Error Identification:** Systematically identify and highlight any potential errors related to punctuation, spelling, or inconsistencies, particularly focusing on technical terms and specialized vocabulary.\n3.  **Correction and Justification:** For each identified error, determine the most appropriate correction based on the established context. Assess the potential for misinterpretation if the error remains uncorrected. Implement corrections only when absolute confidence exists that the change will significantly enhance clarity and accuracy.\n4.  **Structural Reorganization:** Ensure the final output is rigorously organized into clear, cohesive, and logical paragraphs. All sentences within these paragraphs must be complete, grammatically correct, and effectively convey the intended meaning.\n5.  **Cautionary Principle:** Absolutely avoid making any changes when there is uncertainty regarding the correctness of the original text or if the correction does not demonstrably improve overall accuracy or readability. Do not introduce new errors.\n\n**Response Format:**\nProvide your output in the following structured plaintext format:\n\n<corrections>\n- Original: [the exact original text segment]\n  Correction: [the corrected text segment]\n  Reason: [a concise explanation for the correction, referencing context, grammatical rules, or domain-specific conventions]\n</corrections>\n\n\n<corrected_text> [The full, revised text, meticulously arranged into logical paragraphs and composed entirely of complete sentences] </corrected_text>\n\nPrioritize absolute accuracy and clarity in all corrections and structural adjustments. If a segment is not incorrect or its correction is uncertain, leave it unchanged.",

This enhancement significantly reduces the time required for complex computations. Our primary sensor array consists of five elements, each designed for specific spectral analysis. These elements work in conjunction to provide a comprehensive dataset, enabling more accurate environmental monitoring and predictive analytics. Each component is meticulously calibrated to ensure optimal performance across various operational conditions. This integrated approach ensures robust and reliable data acquisition for critical applications.\n</corrected_text>",
