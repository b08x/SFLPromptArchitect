# Authentication Integration Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the manual testing steps to verify the authentication integration fixes.

## Before Testing
1. Clear browser localStorage and cookies
2. Start the backend server
3. Start the frontend development server

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Initial Load Without Authentication
**Expected Behavior:**
- User visits site
- AuthGuard detects no authentication
- Shows authentication modal immediately
- No API calls to `/api/providers/health` occur before authentication

**Steps:**
1. Open browser developer tools (Network tab)
2. Navigate to the application
3. Verify authentication modal appears
4. Check Network tab - should NOT see any 401 errors from `/api/providers/health`

### Test Case 2: Successful Authentication Flow
**Expected Behavior:**
- User logs in successfully
- Provider validation runs AFTER authentication
- No 401 errors in network logs
- User sees application content

**Steps:**
1. Fill in login credentials in the modal
2. Submit the form
3. Monitor Network tab
4. Verify successful login response
5. Verify provider health check happens AFTER login
6. Check that provider validation calls use Authorization headers
7. Confirm no 401 errors appear

### Test Case 3: Authentication with Existing Token
**Expected Behavior:**
- User with valid token sees app immediately
- Provider validation runs automatically with authentication

**Steps:**
1. Login successfully first
2. Refresh the page
3. Verify app loads without showing auth modal
4. Verify provider validation runs immediately

### Test Case 4: Token Expiration Handling
**Expected Behavior:**
- Expired token is detected
- User is redirected to authentication
- Provider validation stops until re-authentication

**Steps:**
1. Manually expire token in localStorage (set exp field to past date)
2. Refresh page or trigger API call
3. Verify auth modal appears
4. Verify no unauthorized API calls continue

## Success Criteria
- ✅ No 401 errors from `/api/providers/health` in network logs
- ✅ Authentication modal appears for unauthenticated users
- ✅ Provider validation only runs after successful authentication
- ✅ All API calls include proper Authorization headers
- ✅ Seamless user experience without race conditions

## Network Requests to Monitor
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Should succeed
- `GET /api/providers/health` - Should only occur AFTER authentication
- `GET /api/providers/status` - Should include Authorization header
- All provider-related API calls should be authenticated

## Common Issues Fixed
1. **Race Condition**: Provider validation no longer starts before authentication
2. **Missing Auth Headers**: All provider service calls now use `authService.authenticatedFetch`
3. **Timing Issues**: AuthGuard properly coordinates with provider validation hook
4. **State Management**: Provider validation resets when user logs out

## Files Modified
- `frontend/services/providerService.ts` - All API calls now authenticated
- `frontend/hooks/useProviderValidation.ts` - Only runs after authentication
- `frontend/components/AuthGuard.tsx` - Triggers provider validation after login
- `frontend/App.tsx` - Coordinates authentication and provider validation
- `frontend/services/authService.ts` - Fixed API base URL
